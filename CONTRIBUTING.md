## Getting Started: Your Contribution Journey Begins

1. **Fork the Repository:** Fork the DIRAI repository to your own GitHub account. This creates a copy of the project under your account where you can make your changes.
    
2. **Clone Your Fork:** Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/salah-alhajj/dirai.git 
    cd dirai
    ```
    
3. **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch for your contribution. Use a descriptive name that reflects the nature of your work. This helps keep the `main` branch clean and organized.
    
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/my-awesome-feature
    ```
    
    or
    
    ```bash
    git checkout -b bugfix/fix-that-bug
    ```
    
4. **Set Up Your Development Environment:**
    
    ```bash
    pip install -e .[dev]
    ```
    This installs DIRAI in editable mode along with development dependencies like `pytest` for testing.
    
5. **Make Your Changes:** Implement your changes, write tests, and update documentation as needed.
    
6. **Commit Your Changes:** Commit your changes with clear and concise commit messages. We recommend following the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for better commit message structure. This makes it easier to understand the history of the project.
    
7. **Push Your Changes:** Push your branch to your forked repository.
    
    ```bash
    git push origin your-branch-name
    ```
    
8. **Open a Pull Request:** Go to the original DIRAI repository on GitHub and open a pull request from your branch to the `main` branch.
    

## Development Guidelines: Best Practices for DIRAI

### Code Style: The DIRAI Way

-   Adhere to [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guidelines. We use `flake8` to enforce this. You can run `flake8` locally before committing to check for style issues.
-   Use meaningful variable and function names that clearly indicate their purpose.
-   Write clear and concise comments to explain complex logic or non-obvious code.
-   Keep functions and methods short and focused on a single task.

### Testing: Ensuring DIRAI's Reliability

-   Write unit tests for your code using the `pytest` framework.
-   Aim for high test coverage, ensuring that your tests cover all new functionality and edge cases.
-   Run tests locally before submitting a pull request to catch issues early:
    
    ```bash
    pytest
    ```
    

### Documentation: Illuminating the Path

-   Update the documentation (including the README) to reflect any changes you make.
-   Clearly document any new features or functionalities you add.
-   Ensure the documentation is easy to understand and follow.

## Pull Request Process: From Proposal to Integration

1. **Submit a Pull Request:** Once your changes are ready, submit a pull request to the `main` branch of the DIRAI repository.
    
2. **Describe Your Changes:** In the pull request description, provide a clear and detailed explanation of:
    
    -   The purpose of your changes.
    -   The problem you are solving (if applicable).
    -   The approach you have taken.
    -   Any relevant issue numbers.
    
    The more context you provide, the easier it will be for reviewers to understand your contribution.
    
3. **Code Review:** Your pull request will be reviewed by the maintainers. Be prepared to address feedback, answer questions, and make changes if necessary. This is a collaborative process, and we appreciate your patience and responsiveness.
    
4. **Approval and Merge:** Once your pull request is approved, it will be merged into the `main` branch, and your contribution will become part of DIRAI! üéâ
